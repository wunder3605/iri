Traditional blockchain: slow transaction rate (about 7/sec), waste of energy.
Hybrid chain based system is one of the way to solve the problem -- super nodes ( with most computing power or most wealth) are elected and only super nodes have the privilege to commit blocks.
TRIAS Leviatom elect the most trustable nodes as super nodes.
The technologies backing this idea are: 
Trusted computing (TEE) for attesting and verifying nodes;
DAG based gossip consensus protocol to propagate trust information and help make election decision.
