\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we proposed a way to compute how to grow the blocks in the growing DAG based blockchain systems. 
And how to maintain the total order as the DAG structure is dynamically turning larger.
We referred one of the earliest DAG implementation IRI to conduct our own experiments on clusters of different size and topology. 
Despite the network inefficiency in the IRI implementation, 
our method is proven to be able to tolerate the increasing complexity of the graph computation problems involved. 
This is due to the streaming graph computing techniques we have introduced in this paper.
