\section{Optimization Methods}
One of the biggest challenges to maintain the stability of DAG system is that, 
as the local data structure grows, the graph algorithms ($Pivot()$, $MCMC()$, $StreamNetOrder()$), 
relies on some of the graph operators that need to be recalculated for every newly generated block,
which are very expensive. 
Table~\ref{tab:properties} list all the expensive graph operators that are called. 
Suppose the depth of the pivot chain is $d$, then we give the analysis of complexity in the following way. 
$ParentScore()$  and $Score()$ rely on the breath first search ($BFS$), and the average $BFS$
complexity would be $O(|B|)$,
and for each MCMC() and Pivot() called 
the complexity would be in total $O(|B|^2)$ in both of these two cases.
The calculation of $Past()$ also relies on the $BFS$ operator, in the StreamNetOrder() algorithm, the complexity would be 
accrued to $O(|B| * d)$.
TopOrder() is used in sub-order ranking the blocks in the same epoch.
It's the classical topological sorting problem, and the complexity in the StreamNetOrder() would be $O(|B|)$.

Past(G,b) - Past(G,p) & StreamNetOrder() & $O(|B|)$              & $O(|B|*d)$  \\ \hline
TopOrder(G, b)        & StreamNetOrder() & $O(|B|)$              & $O(|B|)$    \\ \hline

Considering new blocks are generated and merged into the local data structure in a streaming way.
The expensive graph properties could be maintained dynamically as the DAG grows.
Such that the complexity of calculating these properties would be amortized to each time a new block is generated or merged.
In the following sections, we will discuss how to design streaming algorithms to achieve this goal.

\subsection{Optimization of Score() and ParentScore() }
In the optimized version, the DAG will have a map that keeps the score of each block. Once there is a new generated/merged block,
it will trigger the BFS based UpdateScore() algorithm to update the scores of the block in the map that are referenced by the new block.
The skeleton of the UpdateScore() algorithm is as Algorithm~\ref{algo:update_score} shows.

\input{./algorithms/update_score.tex}

\subsection{Optimization of Past(G,b) - Past(G,p)}

We abbreviate the Past(G,b) - Past(G,p) to calculate $B\delta$ as GetDiffSet(G,b,C) which is shown in the Algorithm~\ref{algo:get_diff_set}.
This algorithm is in essence a dual direction $BFS$ algorithm. Starting from the block $b$, it will traverse all its referenced blocks.
Every time a new reference block $b'$ is discovered, it will perform a backward $BFS$ to `look back' to see if itself is already covered by the $b$'s parent block $p$. 
If yes, $b'$ would not be added to the forward $BFS$ queue.  
To avoid the complexity of the backward $BFS$, the previous calculated diff set will be added to the covered set $C$, which will be passed to GetDiffSet() as a parameter.
To be more specific, when a backward BFS is performed, the blocks in $C$ will not be added to the search queue.
This backward search algorithm is denoted as IsCovered() and described in detail in Algorithm~\ref{algo:is_covered}.

Figure~\ref{get_diff} shows the example of the GetDiffSet() method for block $5$.
It first perform forward BFS to find block $4$ which does not have children, then it will be added to the diff set.
$4$ then move forward to $1$, which have three children, if it detect $3$ which is the parent of $5$, it will stop searching promptly.
If it continue searching on $2$ or $4$, these two blocks would not be added to the search queue, because they are already in the covered set.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Optimization of TopOrder()}
The topological order is used in sorting the blocks in the same epoch.
To get the topological order, every time, there needs a top sort of the whole DAG from the scratch.
However we can easily update the topological order when a new block is added or merged.
The update rule is, when a new block is added, it's topological position will be as (1) shows. This step can be done in $O(1)$ 

\begin{equation}
    \begin{flalign*}
        & TopScore(G, b) \gets min(TopScore(G, Parent(b)), \\
        & TopScore(G, Reference(b))) + 1
    \end{flalign*}
\end{equation}


To summarize, the optimized streaming operators can achieve the performance improvement as Table~\ref{tab:improvement} shows.

    \resizebox{\linewidth}{!}{
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
\hline
Graph Property        & Algorithm used   & Complexity & Tot \\ \hline
Score(G, b)           & MCMC()           & $O(|B|)$              & $O(|B|)$  \\ \hline
ParentScore(G, b)     & Pivot()          & $O(|B|)$              & $O(|B|)$  \\ \hline
Past(G,b) - Past(G,p) & StreamNetOrder() & $O(|B|)$              & $O(|B|)$  \\ \hline
TopOrder(G, b)        & StreamNetOrder() & $O(|1|)$              & $O(|1|)$    \\ \hline
\end{tabular}}
\end{center}
\end{table}

\subsection{Genesis Forwarding}
The above algorithm solved the problem of how to dynamically maintaining the information needed for graph computation.
However, it still needs to update the information until genesis block. 
With the size of the graph growing, the updating process will become harder to compute.
With the grwoth of DAG size, the old historical confirmed blocks are being confirmed by more and more blocks, 
which are hard to be mutated.
And the exact probability can be computed in formula (1).
Hence, we can design a strategy to forward the genesis periodically and fix the historical blocks into a total ordered chain.
The criteria to forward the genesis are based on the threshold of ParentScore().
Suppose we define this threshold as $h = n-m $, then we only forward the genesis if: 

\begin{equation}
    \begin{flalign*}
        & \exists b | b \in Chain(G, g), for \\ 
        & \forall b' | b' \in \overline{Chain(G,g)}, such that \\
        & ParentScore(b) > ParentScore(b') + h 
    \end{flalign*}
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{figures/genesis_forward.pdf}
    \caption{
        Example of genesis forward method. 
     }
\label{genesis_forward}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

In Figure~\ref{genesis_forward}, we set $h=5$, and there are three side chains with $\forall b' | b' \in \overline{Chain(G,g)}$, $ParentScore(b')<=4$.
And in pivot chain, there are multiple blocks $b$ that has $ParentScore(b) >= 9$, they are condidates for the new genesis, 
we choose the block with minimumn $ParentScore$ as the new genesis.

In addition, after the new genesis has been chosen, 
we will induce a new DAG in memory from this genesis,
and persist the `snapshot' total order (Conflux paper has the same definition, 
but it does not show the technical detail, we do not view it trivial) in the local data base.
Once the total order is queried, a total order based on the current DAG will be appended to the end of the historical
snapshot total order and be returned.
In addition, the vertices in UTXO graph that belongs to the fixed blocks will 
be eliminated from the memory and be persisted to disk as well.  
The algorithm is as Algorithm~\ref{algo:genesis_forward} shows.

\subsection{The Direct Signal Gossip Protocol}
To minimize the message passing in the gossip network,
there are solutions in \cite{demers1988epidemic}. And in Hyperledger \cite{androulaki2018hyperledger}
they have adopted the PUSH and PULL model for the gossip message propagation. However, their system is aiming at permissioned chain.
Suppose the size of the hash of a block is $H$, we designed the direct signal algorithm.
The algorithm is divided into two steps, once a node generate or receive a block,
it firstly broadcast the hash of the block, this is the PUSH step.
Once a node receive a hash or a set of a hash,
it will pick one source of the hash for the block content, this is the PULL step.
The direct signal algorithm's complexity will be $O(LH + NB)$ and for a node averaged to $O(\frac{LH}{N} + 1)$
The algorithm is as Algorithm~\ref{algo:gossip} shows.
