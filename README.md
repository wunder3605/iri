# Trias StreamNet

The trias-lab/iri repository is the main StreamNet reference implementation, 
for the design details, please see yellow paper [[StreamNet]](https://github.com/triasteam/iri/blob/dev/document/yellow\_paper/StreamNet/StreamNet.pdf). 
The original iri reference could be found at [[iri]](https://github.com/iotaledger/iri).

## 1. Installing

The preferred option is that you compile yourself.
The second option is that you utilize the provided jar, 
which is released whenever there is a new update here: [Github Releases](https://github.com/trias-lab/iri/releases).

### 1.1 Compiling yourself

Make sure to have Maven and Java 8 installed on your computer.
Or, install gradle by yourself

We only support python 2.7. Python environment need to have: gunicorn, flask, pyota, cryptography>=2.8, ecdsa installed with pip.

Curl also need to be installed.

#### 1.1.1 To compile & package
```bash
git clone https://github.com/StreamUnion/StreamNet.git 
cd StreamNet 
mvn clean compile
mvn package
```

This will create a `target` directory in which you will find the executable jar file that you can use.

#### 1.1.2 To compiple with gradle 

```bash
./gradlew clean test build
```

The reason why you should use gradle is that its compiling script is much more succint and it's better compatible with IntelliJ.
Please search how to integrate gradle project with IntelliJ.

#### 1.1.3 To compiple docker

```bash
docker build -t <name>:<tag> .
```

This will create a docker image for you to deploy

### 1.2 Running yourself

#### 1.2.1 How to run one node

##### Run one node in single transaction mode

```bash
cd scripts/examples/one_node/
./conflux_dag.sh
./start_cli.sh
./parallel_put_txn.sh
./get_balance.sh
```

##### Run one node in batch transaction mode

```bash
cd scripts/examples/one_node_batch
./conflux_dag.sh
./start_cli.sh
./parallel_put_txn.sh
./get_balance.sh
```

#### 1.2.2 How to run two nodes

##### Run two nodes in single transaction mode

```bash
cd scripts/examples/two_nodes
./conflux_dag_two_nodes.sh
./start_cli_two_nodes.sh
./parallel_put_txn_two_nodes.sh
./get_balance_two_nodes.sh
```

##### Run two nodes in multiple transaction mode

```bash
cd scripts/examples/two_nodes_batch
./conflux_dag_two_nodes.sh
./start_cli_two_nodes.sh
./parallel_put_txn_two_nodes.sh
./get_balance_two_nodes.sh
```

#### 1.2.3 How to run docker

```
$ docker run -d --net=host --name <name> -v <local_data_dir>:/iri/data -v <neighbor_file>:/iri/conf/neighbors <name>:<tag> /entrypoint.sh
```
